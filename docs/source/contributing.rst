Guidelines for Submitting Pull Requests
---------------------------------------

We’re excited to have you contribute to TML-CTP! To ensure a smooth and productive collaboration, we recommend that you follow these guidelines when making pull requests. This helps keep the project organized and makes your contributions shine.

When writing your commit messages, we suggest using the following format: ``git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"``.
These commit types align with the Angular Conventional Commits standard, which ensures consistency across the project. You can find more details on this standard `here <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/>`_.

Here’s a quick guide to the commit types you should use:

- **[FEAT]:** For introducing new features or enhancements to existing functionality.
- **[FIX]:** For correcting bugs or issues within the project.
- **[TST]:** For adding or updating tests within the codebase.
- **[DOC]:** For changes or additions to documentation.
- **[STYLE]:** For stylistic changes that do not alter the functionality of the code, such as formatting adjustments.
- **[REFACTOR]:** For refactoring existing code without changing its behavior.
- **[CI]:** For updates to the continuous integration setup or related scripts.
- **[CHORE]:** For routine tasks such as dependency updates or other maintenance activities.

.. Tip::
    When adding files to your commits, we encourage you to avoid using the commands `git add --all`and `git add .`.
    Instead, aim to add only the topical files directly related to your changes. This approach makes code reviews simpler and more focused on the changes you have made.
